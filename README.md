# dev-env

Creating a boilerplate for my future dev environments. I'm tired of doing this each time and I tend to spend more time on this than just getting in there and coding

Basing this off the pluralsight [video](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/javascript-development-environment/exercise-files) by Cory House.

## How to Start

1. Clone this project
2. `cd dev-env`
3. `npm i`
